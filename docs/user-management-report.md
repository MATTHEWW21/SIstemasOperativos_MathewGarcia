# User Management Report
Users alice, bob, and charlie were created to simulate a development and QA team. Groups (developers, testers, administrators) were used to assign permissions based on roles. Shared directories were configured with group ownership and restrictive permissions to enforce least privilege. Security best practices included unique accounts, strong passwords, and regular audits.
