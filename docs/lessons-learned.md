during this lab, I learned how GRUB2 manage the Linux boot
process and how to safely modify its configuration, such as 
adjusting the boot timeout and making the boot menu visible. 
I faced permission challenges when editing system files, which
i solved by using elevated privileges with sudo, and i also
dealt with the GRUB menu not showing at startup, learning how to
fix it through configuration changes. The lab highlighted the
importance of making backups and snapshots before system modifi-
cations and taught me practical recovery techniques like using
GRUB rescue mode and live USB enviroments to restore system boot
functionality.
