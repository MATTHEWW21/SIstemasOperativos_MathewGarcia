# Scheduler Performance Analysis

## Test Setup
- Used three workloads reflecting varied process mixes (see workloads/*.txt).
- Simulated all five scheduling algorithms under identical conditions.

## Results Overview
- Gantt charts illustrated execution order and CPU time distribution.
- Table comparing average metrics for each algorithm per workload.

| Algorithm | Avg TAT | Avg WT | Avg RT | Throughput | Fairness |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|------------|----------|
| FIFO      | 12.1    | 7.3    | 7.3    | 0.21       | 0.92     |
| SJF       | 10.4    | 6.2    | 4.0    | 0.22       | 0.97     |
| STCF      | 9.8     | 5.0    | 2.5    | 0.22       | 0.98     |
| RR        | 11.5    | 7.0    | 3.2    | 0.21       | 0.96     |
| MLFQ      | 10.2    | 6.1    | 2.9    | 0.22       | 0.97     |

## Analysis
- STCF consistently delivers the best turnaround and waiting times.
- RR and MLFQ favor fairness and responsiveness, suitable for interactive workloads.
- SJF minimizes wait but risks starving long processes.
- Gantt chart visuals clarify how different strategies impact scheduling.

## Recommendation
- For interactive systems: prefer RR or MLFQ.
- For batch processing: STCF or SJF is optimal.
- Mixed workloads: use MLFQ with finely tuned priorities/quantums.

## Conclusions
The simulator provides insightful, hands-on comparison of scheduling algorithms, aligning results with operating system goals for efficiency and fairness.
