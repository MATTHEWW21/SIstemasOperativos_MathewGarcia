# Test Results for msgbuf Kernel Module

## Basic Test
- Write and read operations succeed as expected.
- IOCTL commands to get buffer size and clear buffer work correctly.

## Concurrency Test
- Ten processes writing concurrently show no data corruption or deadlocks.
- Statistics in `/proc/msgbuf_stats` match expected values.

## Stress Test
- 100 concurrent processes writing simultaneously cause no kernel errors or crashes.
- System remains stable throughout testing.

## Summary
The module meets all functional requirements and is robust under concurrent and high-load conditions.
